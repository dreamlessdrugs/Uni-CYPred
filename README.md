# Uni-CYPred

### Uni-CYPred is an open-source software specifically designed for predicting potential inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 enzymes, based on our existing best models.

## Getting started

### 1. Single-Molecule Prediction

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In "Single-Molecule Prediction" module, first input the SMILES string of the compound. Next, select the CYP450 isoforms you aim to predict in the "Select Prediction Models" section. Once you have made your selection, click the "START PREDICTION" button to initiate the prediction process. The prediction results will be displayed directly in the table below. Meanwhile, we also support downloading the results, just click the "Save Results" button below the table. Note that the downloaded file will contain all the data currently displayed in the table.

### 2. Batch Prediction

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In "Batch Prediction" module, we provide support for predicting a collection of compounds simultaneously. However, the way to input compounds is different. You should click the "Browse" button to upload a file in txt or sdf format that contains the compounds. The subsequent steps are the same as those in "Single-Molecule Prediction" module.
